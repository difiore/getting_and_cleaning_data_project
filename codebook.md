## Codebook for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Programming Assignment

This codebook modifies and updates the codebooks provided with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries I calculated. For each variable, the units are as indicated in the original dataset.

**ACTIVITIES** in the `full_data` dataset (produced in the `run_analysis.R` script are are coded by number (in the `activity` column). In the `tidy_data` dataset, they are coded by both number (in the `activity` column)and name (in the `activity_name` column). And in the `tidy_summarized_data` dataset, they are coded by name only (in the `activity` column). The following table summarizes the coding scheme used.

|Activity Code|Activity Name     |
|-------------|------------------|
|1            |WALKING           |
|2            |WALKING_UPSTAIRS  |
|3            |WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS|
|4            |SITTING           |
|5            |STANDING          |
|6            |LAYING            |


The **FEATURES** (or **VARIABLES**) present in the original dataset are described as coming...

>from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
> These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
>'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Various summary statistics (e.g., `mean`, `st dev`, `max`, `min`, etc.) were then derived for many of these variables. The set of 66 `mean` and `st dev` variables were extracted from the full dataset for analysis here (these are listed below and are included in the `tidy_data` dataset produced by the `run_analysis.R` script):

* tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
* tBodyAcc-std()-X
* tBodyAcc-std()-Y
* tBodyAcc-std()-Z

Finally, in the final `tidy_summarized_data` dataset, the average of each of these same variables is calculated by **SUBJECT** (indexed as a number) and **ACTIVITY** (referred to by name according to the categories above).
